# Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem.
This technique is often used when a problem can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems.
In recursion, the function continues to call itself with a smaller or simpler input until it 
reaches a base case, which is a condition that stops the recurion.
