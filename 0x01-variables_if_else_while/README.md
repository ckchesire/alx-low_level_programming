# C Programming Fundamentals: Variables, If-Else, and While Loop

This repository contains code examples and explanations covering fundamental concepts in C programming: Variables, If-Else statements, and While loops. These topics are essential for building a strong foundation in C and understanding more complex programming concepts.

Variables

Variables are named memory locations used to store data in a program. In C, you need to declare a variable before using it by specifying its data type and assigning it avalue.

Types of Variables

There are different types of variables in C:

    Local Variables: Declared inside a function and have a local scope.
    Global Variables: Declared outside all functions and have a global scope.
    Static Variables: Retain their values between function calls.

If-Else Statements

If-Else statements are used for decision-making in a program. They allow you to execute different blocks of code based on a specified condition.

While Loop

A While loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It is useful when you don't know in advance how many times you need to execute thecode.
