# Pointers, arrays and strings

What is a Pointer?

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are powerful because they allow you to work directly with memory, which can lead to more efficient and flexible programs.

What is an Array?

An array is a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays allow you to store and access multiple values using a single variable name.

What is a String?

In C, a string is an array of characters terminated by a null character ('\0'). Strings are used to represent text.
