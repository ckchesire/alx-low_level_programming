# alx-low_level_programming

This repository contains solutions and projects related to low-level programming, specifically using the C programming language, as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The projects and exercises focus on fundamental concepts of computer science and programming at a low level, including:

- Basic syntax and structure of C
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and recursion
- Pointers and memory management
- Data structures (arrays, linked lists)
- File I/O
- Compilation process and Makefiles
- Debugging techniques

Each directory in the repository corresponds to a specific project or exercise, with detailed instructions and source code files. This repository serves as a learning resource and a reference for mastering the essentials of low-level programming and developing a strong foundation in C programming.
